# audio.py
#
# purpose: handles audio recording from the default microphone. includes
#          functionality for starting/stopping recording, detecting periods
#          of silence to automatically stop recording, and saving the captured
#          audio to a temporary wav file suitable for transcription.
#
# dependencies: sounddevice (audio i/o)
#               numpy (numerical operations for audio data, rms calculation)
#               wave (saving audio to .wav format)
#               tempfile (creating temporary files)
#               asyncio (for running the collection loop concurrently)
#
# key components: recorder class
#                 start method (initializes and starts the audio stream)
#                 _collect method (async task to read audio chunks, detect silence)
#                 stop method (stops stream, saves buffer to temp wav file)
#                 sr, ch, silence_db, hang (constants for sample rate, channels,
#                                            silence threshold, hang time)
#
# design rationale: uses sounddevice for cross-platform audio input. silence
#                   detection is based on root mean square (rms) of audio chunks
#                   compared to a db threshold. asyncio is used in _collect to
#                   avoid blocking while waiting for audio data. saving to a temp
#                   file simplifies passing audio data to the transcription api.
